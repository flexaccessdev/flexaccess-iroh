//! Endpoint construction shared by every FlexAccess program: the common
//! builder and the bind-and-come-online policy.
//!
//! Identity is the application's: it reads and decodes its own secret-key
//! file (or generates an ephemeral key) and binds the resulting
//! [`iroh::SecretKey`] on the builder itself.
//!
//! Applications layer their own ALPNs, hooks, identity, and QUIC transport
//! tuning onto the [`iroh::endpoint::Builder`] returned by
//! [`endpoint_builder`], then hand it to [`create_endpoint`].
