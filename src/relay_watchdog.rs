//! Server-side home-relay watchdog.
//!
//! A server configured with custom relays is reachable to off-LAN clients
//! *only* through its home relay: with n0 discovery off, clients dial with
//! relay hints, and a relay forwards QUIC Initials only to endpoints currently
//! registered on it. iroh keeps that registration alive on its own, but it has
//! been observed (v1.0.3, relays behind Cloudflare tunnels that reset idle
//! WebSockets roughly hourly) to silently lose its home relay for good after
//! one such reset: no dial retries, no warnings, no registration on any relay —
//! the server just stops being dialable until the process is restarted, while
//! LAN clients that find it over mDNS keep working and mask the outage.
//!
//! [`watch_home_relay`] observes [`Endpoint::home_relay_status`] and reacts in
//! two steps, mirroring the client's reconnect escalation:
//!
//! 1. after [`RELAY_OUTAGE_NUDGE`] without a connected home relay it calls
//!    [`Endpoint::network_change`], which forces a fresh net report and relay
//!    re-selection (enough when only the bookkeeping went stale);
//! 2. after the caller's rebuild deadline ([`RELAY_OUTAGE_REBUILD`] by
//!    default) it resolves, telling the caller to replace the endpoint — the
//!    in-process equivalent of the restart that is known to fix it. The caller
//!    (the server's serve loop) closes the wedged endpoint, binds a fresh one
//!    with the same identity (see [`crate::endpoint::rebuild_endpoint`]), and
//!    serves on again.
//!
//! The resolution also says whether a home relay was connected at *any* point
//! of the watch ([`RelayOutage::relay_seen`]). A rebuilt endpoint that never
//! registers is a sign the relay itself is unreachable, not that iroh's
//! bookkeeping went stale; rebuilding it again drops every LAN client for
//! nothing, so the caller backs off between such rebuilds by passing a longer
//! deadline.
//!
//! Only the *home* relay matters: non-home relays are connected on demand and
//! dropped after a minute idle, which is normal and not an outage.
